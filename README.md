-Data Source:

Prosper Loan Data  which contains 113,937 records and 81 columns.

-Exploratory Analysis:

1- Loan amount is negatively correlated with Borrower rate, EstimatedReturn, and Interesteandfees.

Analyse the Distribution of Borrower Rate then figure out count and proportions of Term, ProsperRating (Alpha), IsBorrowerHomeowner, and LoanStatus.
